# Legacy Materials

This folder contains unrelated or older experimental artifacts that predate the current NarrativeGuard work and are retained only for historical reference. Examples include legacy/conflict-risk/config.yaml, legacy/conflict-risk/Makefile, legacy/conflict-risk/docs/methods.md, legacy/conflict-risk/src/*, legacy/backup-data/city_bucket_docs_BACKUP.csv, and legacy/old-outputs/ablation_r2.png and ablation_rmse.png.
They are not part of the NarrativeGuard pipeline.
