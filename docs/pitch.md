I built an end-to-end pipeline that aggregates news into city-month documents and predicts next-month conflict event counts. The text side uses TF-IDF plus a few simple lexical cues, which I merge with structured indicators from a Middle East dataset using the Conflict_Events_Next label. I ran a clean ablation across structured-only, text-only, and combined features; the combined model consistently improves over structured-only, while text-only is weaker due to coverage noise. The takeaway is that text adds a modest lift when it is grounded with structured signals. I can walk through the data join logic, feature construction, and how the ablation was validated.
